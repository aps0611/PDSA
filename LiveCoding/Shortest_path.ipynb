        "Once upon a time, there was a group of adventurous friends who decided to go on a jungle expedition.\n",
        "They were exploring the dense, uncharted jungles of “Mystica’. While enjoying their journey, they realized they had lost their way back to the camp.\n",
        "The jungle was like a maze with various interconnected paths, and the friends had a map that displayed some landmarks and the connections between them.\n",
        "Each landmark was represented by a unique integer identifier, and they knew that the connections were bidirectional.\n",
        "\n",
        "Write a function shortest_path_to_camp(totai_landmarks, connections, current_landmark, camp_landmark) that takes the following parameters:\n",
        "total_landmarks: An integer n, represents the total number of landmarks in the jungle labelled from 1 to n.\n",
        "connections: A dictionary which represents the adjacency list of connections, where each key represents the source landmark and values represent the list of adjacent landmarks of the source landmark.\n",
        "current_landmark: An integer, the current landmark where the friends are currently located.\n",
        "camp_ landmark: An integer, the landmark of their camp.\n",
